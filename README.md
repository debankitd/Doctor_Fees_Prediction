This project aims to create a web interface that allows users to predict doctor consultation fees based on their input. The machine learning model was trained on a dataset obtained by scraping data from the Practo website using Selenium. With the use of Python Pandas, the scraped data was thoroughly cleaned & preprocessed for accurate predictions.

**1. Data Collection:** Gathered doctor-related information from Practo using web scraping techniques with Selenium.

**2. Data Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.

**3. Feature Engineering:** Derived additional relevant features from the existing dataset, such as extracting qualifications.

**4. Model Selection:** Explored various regression algorithms and selected potential candidates based on initial performance evaluation.

**5. Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for each selected model, optimizing their performance.

**6. Model Training:** Trained multiple models on the dataset with the tuned hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.

**7. Weighted Voting:** Implemented a Weighted Voting technique, combining predictions from multiple models, each with a specific weight.

**8. Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the ensemble model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.

## 🏥 Challenges and Learnings

**1. Feature Engineering:** Handled complex features, especially those with diverse and numerous categories. 

**2. Model Selection:**  Explored different ML models to identify the Best models.

**3. Hyperparameter Tunning:**  Hyperparameter tuning was time-consuming due to limited time for model development

**4. Model Deployment:**  Explored model deployment options.

 
## 🏥 Conclusion

**1. Healthcare Accessibility:** By giving patients an idea of potential costs, it helps them seek appropriate medical care without the barrier of uncertainty about fees.

**2. Transparency and Trust:**  Clear fee estimates foster trust and confidence in medical services, enhancing the doctor-patient relationship.

**3. Efficiency for Providers:** With fee estimates readily available, administrative processes become smoother, leading to improved overall service efficiency.
